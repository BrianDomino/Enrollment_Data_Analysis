# Enrollment_Data_Analysis
Takes a folder of enrollment data in CSV format, and calculates efficiency, credit hour production by instructor, and fees by semester.
Bar graphs are also plotted of these three by semester.

This is my first Python project, so don't use it as a model. It does work, though, and I have tried to make it generic so that it can
be easily adapted to other uses/data.
